Set small daily goals and track your progress. Typing is a skill that improves gradually with patience, discipline, and a little bit of fun.",
    "Technology evolves rapidly, changing how we live, work, and communicate. Coding is a powerful tool in this digital world. It allows you to build websites, automate tasks, and create apps. By understanding programming, you become more than just a user-you become a creator, shaping the future with your knowledge.",
    "Reading and writing are foundational skills, but typing brings them to life in the modern age. A fast, accurate typist can get ideas out quickly and efficiently. Typing games and challenges help improve these skills. Practice consistently and stay motivated. Progress may be slow, but improvement always comes with effort.","JavaScript is used to make websites interactive. It can respond to user actions, update content without reloading, and create dynamic animations. Understanding JavaScript opens the door to front-end development. Itâ€™s one of the most popular languages in the world and a great starting point for aspiring web developers everywhere.",
